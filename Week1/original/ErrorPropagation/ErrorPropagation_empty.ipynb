    "\n",
    "The example is based on FIRST doing the error propagation analytically, and then verifying it by running a so-called Monte-Carlo (MC) program, which uses random numbers for propagating errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we want to try to see, if we can solve the above error propagation problem using simulation. The method is relatively straight forward: You simply take \"realistic\" values of the input parameters x (here Length (x1) and Width (x2)), calculate the resulting value y (here Perimeter, Area, and Diagonal), and do this many times. The resulting distribution of y should be centered around the value y(x1,x2), and the standard deviation should reflect the uncertainty in y from the uncertainties in the input variables.\n",

Put in the correct expression for y in terms of x1=L and x2=W in order to calculate the perimeter, area, and diagonal length, and run the program. Does the output correspond well with the results you expected from your analytical calculations to begin with?\n",
