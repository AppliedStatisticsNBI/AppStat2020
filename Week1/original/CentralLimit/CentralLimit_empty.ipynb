    "The aim of this notebook is to illustrate the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) through concrete examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you add random numbers from different distributions, but with similar variance (or standard deviation), together and plot the distribution of these sums, you end up with a Gaussian distribution, as dictated by the CLT. \n",
    "The example also illustrates how widths (and therefore uncertainties) are added in quadrature, as one has to divide the sum by the square root of the number of random numbers that went into the sum in order to get a Gaussian of unit width (when using random numbers of unit width, i.e. RMS $= \\sigma = 1$).\n",
