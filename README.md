# Applied Statistics 2019 - Code Repository

This git is a repository of the code that will be used in the Applied Statistics code 2019 edition.

## Getting Started


The following instructions will help you install the relevant software that will be used in the course.

Note that you have two options for installing and running the applied statistics notebooks. The first option involves running the code on [ERDA](https://erda.ku.dk), a KU-based server platform that has the advantage of having a uniform software environment for everyone. If you are not enrolled as a KU student, you should contact [Troels](mailto:petersen@nbi.dk) to get access to the ERDA servers. The second option is to install everything on your laptop, using the anaconda environment as a standard set of python libraries. 

We highly recommend that you use __BOTH__ methods throughout the course. Having a local copy of the exercices can become very handy when the ERDA servers are down (for maintenance or other reasons).

### Option A. Running things on ERDA
---


* [__The instructions for using ERDA are available here__](./docs/install_instruction_erda.md)

### Option B. Running things on your laptop
---

If you want to run things on your local computer, you will have to install additional software to be able to properly run the notebooks. 

Given the wide range of operating systems available out there, we cannot guarantee that the instructions above will work on _all_ platforms. As of now, __the instructions below have been tested on the following systems:__

* [__Instructions for Linux__](./docs/install_instruction_linux.md)

* [__Instructions for Windows 10__](./docs/install_instruction_windows10.md)

* [__Instructions for MacOs Mojave__](./docs/install_instruction_macos_mojave.md)


### Option C. Manually downloading the course content
---

If you do not want to subscribe to github, you can still download manually the content of the repository using the __donwload zip__ option on the main page of this git. [More details are available here]('./docs/manual_copy_of_code.md')


## Running things after installation
---

Once you have installed the required software and cloned the repository, you can run your notebooks, and update the content of the repository by following [__these instructions__](./docs/running_after_install.md)
